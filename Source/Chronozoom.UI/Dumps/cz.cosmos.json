One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation.

In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights. Astronomy presents an excellent example of these trends; and, federating Astronomy archives presents interesting challenges for computer scientists.","id":"47262154-611b-4548-b7b0-e650b502f9c6","mediaSource":"http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64569/tr-2002-75.pdf","mediaType":"Video","order":6,"title":"The World-Wide Telescope, an Archetype for Online Science","uri":"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/82410583?access_key=key-19mhzmz32tdlfhod9ces"}],"id":"c26cfd4b-742b-42cf-bfbe-51ae7e8545ed","time":2012,"title":"WorldWide Telescope"}],"id":"8afeae9b-2897-4668-b59d-36287c0a0463","start":2008.15,"timelines":null,"title":"WorldWide Telescope"}},{"parentTimelineId":"2b415ccb-1f7f-478e-9731-ccc8a72d13fb","timeline":{"FromIsCirca":false,"Height":null,"Regime":"Humanity","ToIsCirca":false,"end":9999,"exhibits":[{"IsCirca":false,"UpdatedBy":null,"UpdatedTime":"/Date(1403061745557-0700)/","contentItems":[{"Year":2007,"attribution":"Microsoft Corporation","description":"Microsoft released its Windows Vista operating system worldwide in January 2007.

Estimated to have been first used around 500 BCE, the Haab' created the basis for the Mayan agrarian cycle, and the months were based on the seasons and agricultural or climatological phenomena.

Berkeley was an elitist who had little sympathies with lower-class settlers. Under Berkeley, commoners paid the greatest tax burdens, while elites reaped the greatest rewards. The wealthiest and most ambitious planters did well under Berkeley because they received the largest and most land grants, licenses to trade with Indians for deerskins, and the best public offices. So when frontiersmen led by Bacon rose in genocidal anger against Indians, Berkeley moved to prevent their actions, not because of his sympathies for Indians, but because an Indian war would undermine a key source of profit -- the deerskin trade -- for elites. After Bacon’s Rebellion, King Charles II blamed Berkeley and the colony’s elites for the troubles, believing that they had pushed common planters too hard. The king recalled Berkeley, replacing him with a new governor. Within a year of losing his governorship, Berkeley died before he could plead his case in front of the king.","id":"0627ec7c-9c49-4c7d-b0ab-0c2ac00b68fc","mediaSource":"","mediaType":"image","order":2,"title":"William Berkeley","uri":"http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/98-0825.jpg"},{"attribution":"Brinkman's Arrest of Nathaniel Bacon, 1904 - Available at Encyclopedia Virginia (encyclopediavirginia.org)","description":"Nathaniel Bacon came to Virginia as a member of a well-connected English family.

After a group of Indians murdered his overseer on his estate along the James River, Bacon began leading groups of armed volunteers to attack Indians. His defiance of the hated Governor Berkeley earned him more support among the common planters on the frontier. However, Bacon quickly learned that he had little control over the angry mob that saw him as their leader.

Instead, they were allies of the Hurons, another Iroquoian-speaking group who were enemies of the Haudenosaunee. For decades in the early to mid-seventeenth century, the Susquehannocks had controlled the flow of furs in the Pennsylvania area. They funneled furs from allies in the Ohio River Valley to European traders. Because of their position, they exchanged furs with French, English, and Dutch traders, which enabled them to get any kind and amount of firearms they wanted. One of their villages even had a cannon. This made them valuable allies of the Hurons and hated enemies of the Haudenosaunee.\nOnce the Haudenosaunee League had finished hammering Indians in the Ohio River Valley, they turned their attention to the Susquehannocks in the 1660s. And with the Ohio Valley then in the hands of the league, Susquehannocks had lost their steady supply of furs, which ended their privileged trade status with European traders and the supply of firearms they provided. Additionally, European diseases had devastated the Susquehannocks, so they could offer little resistance to the more powerful Haudenosaunee warriors who pushed them into the colony of Maryland. Although the colonial governor welcomed the Susquehannocks to Maryland, local colonists did not. A 1,000-man armed mob -- led by John Washington, the great-grandfather of George Washington -- attacked the Susquehannocks in 1675, pushing them into the Virginia frontier on the same lands north of the York River that the defeated Powhatans lived in and that young planters led by Nathaniel Bacon desired. These circumstances explain why the Susquehannocks, originally from Pennsylvania, were living in the Virginia frontier at the time of Bacon’s Rebellion.","id":"f4d7dca0-20ef-416c-a631-8cdf543d58e6","mediaSource":"","mediaType":"image","order":1,"title":"Susquehannock Refugees","uri":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Andaste6.jpg/514px-Andaste6.jpg"},{"attribution":"Available at Historic Jamestowne (nps.gov/jame)","description":"The boundary line settled at the end of the Powhatan Wars did not hold. The colonists’ population continued to grow. Newcomers wanted lands for tobacco plantations, but land south of the York River -- part of the boundary line separating Powhatans from English -- was expensive and had been bought up by colonists of means. New colonists were especially eager to get their own land because this was the key to gaining the right to vote in colonial matters. So these settlers began to view land held by the Powhatans as the answer to their problems.\nThe conflict began during the summer of 1675, when a Virginia planter refused to pay Doeg Indians for some trade goods they had provided. The Doegs appropriated some of the planter’s hogs and fled north across the York River into Powhatan lands. The planter raised a force of neighboring settlers, and they crossed the river in pursuit of the Doegs. When this posse came across some refugee Susquehannocks, they murdered them because they were eager to punish “thieving” Indians… and any Indians would do, at that point. The Susquehannocks retaliated, killing the planter’s son and several others, and more raids followed.\nLocal colonists assembled a militia and wanted to attack all Indians north of the York River. They saw this as an opportunity to not only punish Indians, but also as a chance to seize their land. The colony’s governor at the time, William Berkeley, refused to allow them to do this. Instead, he proposed that the colony build a string of defensive forts along the south shore of the York River that would help to keep Indians out and colonists on their side of the boundary line. Many colonists did not like this because this would mean that their taxes would be raised to pay for the expensive forts, in addition to the lost opportunity to take more Indian land.\nThe following spring (1676) a group of impatient planters persuaded Nathaniel Bacon to take matters in his own hands. Bacon raised a force of 300 men to wage a war of extermination against all Indians. Gov. Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel, yet Bacon and his militia headed across the river and killed some Indians. This “victory” prompted local planters to appoint Bacon to the colony’s representative assembly. In June, Bacon arrived at Jamestown with 500 armed men and bullied the assembly into granting him a commission to kill Indians. Once he and his militia left, however, the governor once again named him a rebel.\nBacon’s militia slaughtered some friendly Pamunkey Indians, before returning to Jamestown to deal with Berkeley. They attacked the colony’s capital and burned it down in September. The rebellion fell apart, though, when Bacon suddenly died from dysentery in October. In January 1677, 1,000 British soldiers landed and restored order to the colony.","id":"e1c69df3-7bc5-47be-8f0b-c26f93144686","mediaSource":"","mediaType":"image","order":0,"title":"Rebelling for the Right to Kill Indians","uri":"http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/images/BaconReb_2.jpg"}],"id":"411bcc62-c5a0-411f-a601-745049d8e722","time":1676,"title":"Bacon's Rebellion"},{"IsCirca":false,"UpdatedBy":null,"UpdatedTime":"/Date(1403061745557-0700)/","contentItems":[{"attribution":"Map of the Powhatan Chiefdom - from Helen C.

The village was the administrative unit of the confederacy, and they paid 80% of their wealth to Powhatan as tribute.\nEach village had several layers of governance. The cockarouse was the first person of dignity in a village. The village elected him or her (women could become cockarouses) to this office for life. Cockarouses exercised authority during times of peace and were in charge of all public and private concerns in a village. They presided over the tribal council and were delegates to Powhatan’s council. Villages also had a weroance, whom Powhatan appointed. These officers were also members of Powhatan’s council. They led hunting and fishing expeditions and were in charge of all military affairs. Weroances exercised the power of life and death over village members and collected tribute due to Powhatan. Each village also had a priest, who was another member of Powhatan’s council. Additionally, tribes (usually composed of several villages) had their own councils that regulated matters of concern for the entire body.\nPowhatan shared his authority over the confederacy with his council, the Matchacomoco, which was composed of cockarouses, weroances, and priests from all the villages. The people of the confederacy convened the Matchacomoco, which held open meetings, declared war or peace, conducted foreign relations, and managed domestic affairs at the confederacy level. Decisions made by the Matchacomoco required unanimity, although Powhatan greatly affected council policy.

John Rolfe introduced the future cash crop to Virginia, and it thrived in the long, hot and humid growing season. When Jamestown transitioned from a private company to a Crown colony in 1624, the monarchy supported tobacco cultivation because they could tax it and make money. Tobacco had become so popular in Europe that this crop became what gold was for the Spanish - its economic lifeblood. By 1700, Virginia was growing thirty million pounds of tobacco annually. This meant that the colony developed as a rural place with huge plantations and few large towns. Additionally, the money made from tobacco attracted more settlers, boosting the colony’s white population to 100,000 by 1700.

As memorialized by Disney, Pocahontas supposedly saved Smith’s life from her murderous and powerful father, Powhatan. However, little more could be further from the truth. As the colonists in Jamestown starved, they began to demand more food from the Powhatans, even stealing when the Indians balked at exchanging more than their communities could afford to trade. When Powhatans caught colonists stealing, they killed them, such as the time they executed seventeen English thieves, stuffed their mouths with corn (as a sign of contempt), and left their corpses outside Jamestown for their countrymen to find.\nAs colonists retaliated with increasingly harsher episodes of violence, the situation threatened to spiral out of control. With tens of thousands of Powhatans potentially arrayed against a handful of starving English, Jamestown’s leaders knew they needed to do something to end of violence. Familiar with the Spanish tactic of conquering indigenous communities by seizing paramount chiefs, John Smith set out to capture Powhatan. Instead, Powhatan captured the bumbling Englishman, and the chief saw an opportunity. He staged a mock execution that Pocahontas, one of his thirty-two children, interrupted at her father’s instructions. But this was no actual execution, as Smith mistakenly thought; it was an adoption ceremony. Powhatan hoped that adopting Smith would bring the troublesome newcomers under his control, help bring peace, and restore the once profitable trade in English goods.\nLike many encounters, misunderstanding on both sides marred this event. Powhatan misunderstood Smith’s gratitude for being alive as consent to his terms: thieving colonists would be controlled, regular tribute would come to Powhatan, and trade would resume. On the other hand, Smith misunderstood the ritual, framing it long after the fact as an incident in which the chief’s thoughtful daughter (then famous in England) had intervened to save his life. After his release, Smith went back to bullying Indians for food and intermittent warfare continued.","id":"fb5626e6-23a4-4f0d-aef3-05897bae20ca","mediaSource":"","mediaType":"image","order":3,"title":"John Smith & Pocahontas","uri":"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/cph/3a50000/3a52000/3a52000/3a52041r.jpg"},{"attribution":"\"First Legislative Assembly\" - Available at Nat'l Parks Service Historic Jamestown (nps.gov/jame)","description":"The high death toll during Jamestown’s early years earned the colony a reputation as more of a slaughterhouse than a place to live.

The resultant typhus and dysentery, along with malarial chills, hit the initial population hard. Early colonists were more interested in finding wealth than in farming. As John Smith noted, the settlers “would rather starve than work.” And starve they did. Of the initial 104 colonists, only 38 remained alive nine months later.

Seeking additional protection from potential Spanish raiders, the ships sailed sixty miles up the James River and founded their colony, which they named after the current King of England. Initially, the newcomers intrigued Powhatan. He wanted them as allies who could help fight his enemies, so he attempted to contain them and subject them to his power. Most especially, he wanted to secure their weapons through trade. Because the colonists were starving during the initial years, the English were also eager to establish trade with the powerful chief. Therefore, relations were amicable in the beginning because each side had something the other wanted.\nBut peace did not last long. Powhatan had learned to distrust Europeans. Some of his people had heard of or suffered from Spanish slave raiders along the coast. And then there was the business with Roanoke -- it is likely that Powhatan had a hand in the demise of whatever village in which the Roanoke survivors might have taken refuge. In 1608, Powhatan moved his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapax along the Chickahominy River in order to put some distance between himself and the colonists. As the newcomers continued to overpressure Powhatan food supplies, trade began to dwindle. Eventually, colonists turned to stealing from the Powhatans, and tensions began to escalate, eventually breaking into episodes of retaliatory violence.\nAt first, Powhatan pursued a policy of containment rather than total war. For example, he got local villages to harass Jamestown. This kept the English confined to the deathtrap that was the colony. At the same time, he disavowed Native attacks on Jamestown and continued trading small amounts with the colony, but never at the quantities the colonists desired. So colonists increased the scale and violence of their attacks, brutally executing the wife and children of a local village’s cockarouse (peace leader), for instance.

Even with growing numbers who left for the North American colonies, England’s population grew to four million by 1650. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, nearly 80% of English people lived in the rural countryside, tending livestock and cultivating grains. But during the sixteenth century, the elite landlords embarked on a program known as enclosure, which fenced in large tracts of their estates and shut out the former and poorer inhabitants. On these enclosed estates, hired laborers tended flocks of sheep while a very small number of tenants remained on lands that were once home to larger numbers. Aristocratic landlords also enclosed common lands that peasants depended upon for grazing their livestock and gathering firewood, fish, and game animals. The enclosure movement increased agricultural productivity and overall national wealth, but it left thousands of peasants and laborers homeless. From 1530 to 1630, about half of the rural peasants lost their lands.\n\nThese homeless peasants roamed the countryside looking for work, eventually ending up in towns and ports such as London. As urban populations grew and increasing numbers of poor people looked for work, wages dropped, inflicting further misery on England’s impoverished people. Rising numbers turned to the public relief system that wealthy property owners inadequately funded. Others turned to crime. By the early seventeenth century, the deteriorating situation prompted elites to promote the North American colonies as a place for England’s landless poor. Many of these “sturdy beggars” began to see indentured servitude, despite its dangers and misery-inducing experience, as a potential way to improve their lives. These demographic and economic pressures provided a basis for England’s settler-style colonialism, a brand of colonization that differentiated it from Spain and France that both had much larger land bases for absorbing their growing populations.","id":"fda3e373-f81f-4a57-ab6b-b8d9eecf4d32","mediaSource":"","mediaType":"image","order":1,"title":"England's Booming Population & Enclosure","uri":"http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/flyingpast/images/Exploring_Cornwalls_Past/Decoding/medieval/st_anthony_F69_117_1.jpg"}],"id":"38a250cd-b117-4a26-afff-1c3e4ede4bd5","time":1558,"title":"Queen Elizabeth Assumes the Throne"},{"IsCirca":false,"UpdatedBy":null,"UpdatedTime":"/Date(1403061745557-0700)/","contentItems":[{"attribution":"Painting \"Sir Walter Raleigh\" at Court House Annex, Richmond, VA, available through Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division (loc.gov)","description":"In the twelfth century, Pope Adrian IV granted to the English crown authority over Ireland, commencing an Anglo-Irish struggle that has unfolded over nearly 800 years.

From 1534 to 1537, the English quelled a rebellion, closed Roman Catholic monasteries, and established a Protestant Church of Ireland. At the heart of English policy, however, was the confiscation of Irish lands, which were in turn handed over to West Country Men, English promoters who sought to establish plantations in Ireland.

Close proximity to livestock had made those from Eurasia and Africa sick countless times, but the survivors had also built up a certain level of resistance among their populations.\nLate in the summer of 1617, Powhatans became sick from what was likely dysentery, or what the colonists called the “bloody flux.” Two years later, another pestilence hit, this time a fever, which swept away more Powhatans.

These developments made them very mad.\nOpechancanough decided to do something about the invading colonists. He used the English murder of Nemattanow, a highly regarded warriors and religious prophet, as the justification for an all-out assault on the English. Working with the weroances from villages under his authority, Opechancanough coordinated a surprise attack that wiped out 347 colonists, which at this time was one-third of the population of Jamestown. Colonial leaders retaliated, using this attack as a pretext to wipe out all Indians -- even those who had not participated -- in the region. They attacked right before the corn harvest that year, which meant that many Indians starved during the subsequent winter. The English also burned a number of villages to the ground. There were also times when the English feigned peace, such as once when they invited Powhatans to a feast to discuss terms of peace; instead, they poisoned their 250 Indian guests.

Maritime trade between England and China began in the 17th century. However, there was a far greater European demand for Chinese goods, such as tea, silk, and porcelain, and little Chinese interest in European goods. As a result, Chinese goods were paid for in silver. In an attempt to stem and reverse the vast flow of silver out of Britain, the East India Company began to sell the addictive and mass-appealing effects of Indian-produced opium to Chinese dealers, in exchange for silver. Recognizing the effects of addiction in its population, Chinese leaders placed bans on opium save in small amounts for medicinal purposes. However, opium continued to be smuggled into and sold in China in the mid-19th century, where tensions culminated in the First and Second Opium Wars.","id":"82d71261-f2ab-4d81-b466-8c77ae2da2e7","mediaSource":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22Sea_Witch%22_opium_clipper_1831.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","order":32767,"title":"\"Water Witch\" Opium Clipper","uri":"https://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/145-_Sea_Witch__opium_clipper_1831.jpg"}],"id":"8153ae70-f8b8-4a32-8a1a-f5b78de17fca","time":1834,"title":"Britain's Opium Trade in Asia"}],"id":"c862d7da-5f1e-4ba4-ab8d-71c8101f76f2","start":1833,"timelines":null,"title":"Steamship Revolution                                                                                "}},{"parentTimelineId":"a404f718-9079-4f2f-aa83-8baa6ca72726","timeline":{"FromIsCirca":false,"Height":600,"Regime":"Humanity","ToIsCirca":false,"end":1860,"exhibits":[{"IsCirca":false,"UpdatedBy":null,"UpdatedTime":"/Date(1403061745557-0700)/","contentItems":[{"Year":1830,"attribution":"Reproduced in Gibbon, Richard (2010).
